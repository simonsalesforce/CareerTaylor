Because staying just to keep the peace is how you end up screaming internally, we are never, ever getting back together â€” with your motivation. You deserve a role that loves you back. Right now? Feels like youâ€™re just playing the part."

This doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re not qualified â€” it just wasnâ€™t your spotlight moment. Next time? You'll come back stronger, with red lipstick and a blank space â€” ready to write their name."

But if every morning feels like youâ€™re showing up in a place where you donâ€™t even recognize yourself anymore, well... maybe it's time to start your own era. Sometimes the best thing you can do is step out in style."

But even if it was bad blood, it still taught you something. Careers, like relationships, donâ€™t always go to plan. Just donâ€™t stay stuck playing a part in someone elseâ€™s love story."

You're not behind â€” youâ€™re just in a different verse. And honestly? Youâ€™re doing better than you think. Itâ€™s me, hi. Youâ€™re the solution. It's you."
